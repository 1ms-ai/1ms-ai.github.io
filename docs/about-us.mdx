Haixuan Xavier Tao is the founder of [1ms.ai](1ms.ai) and started building open source software as a hobby in its weekend, after facing avoidable issues at work.

While building `wonnx`, Futurewei reached out to him to start building `dora-rs` a fast and simple robotic library middleware and this is how 1ms.ai started.

`dora-rs` found its product-market-fit after 2 years when the LLM community tried to put their model in robots and lead 1ms.ai to partner with Huggingface.

The rest is still to be written.
