Haixuan Xavier Tao is the founder of 1ms.ai and started building open source software in its weekend.

While building `wonnx`, Futurewei reached out to him to start building `dora-rs` as an independant open source contractor and this is when 1ms.ai started.

`dora-rs` found its product-market-fit after 2 years within the LLM community that wanted to put their model in robots.

This is when 1ms.ai started partnering with Huggingface.

The rest is still to be written.
